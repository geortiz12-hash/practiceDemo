My Website — Starter HTML Project

What's included
- `index.html` — example responsive page
- `assets/css/styles.css` — basic styles
- `assets/js/main.js` — small JS helpers (mobile nav, year)
- `assets/img/` — place images here
- `package.json` — optional dev server script

Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

1) Preview by opening the file in your browser:

   start .\index.html

2) Or use the dev server (requires Node.js and npm):

   npm install
   npm start

This runs `lite-server` which will serve the folder and auto-reload on changes.

Project structure

- index.html — root page
- assets/css/styles.css — styles
- assets/js/main.js — scripts
- assets/img/ — images

Next steps / suggestions
- Add your own content and images in `assets/img/`
- Replace the placeholder colors and fonts in `assets/css/styles.css`
- Add more pages and wire them into the nav
- Consider using a build tool (Vite, webpack) when it grows
